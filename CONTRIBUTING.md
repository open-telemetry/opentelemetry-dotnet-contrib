## Find a Buddy and Get Started Quickly

If you are looking for someone to help you find a starting point and be a
resource for your first contribution, join our Slack channel and find a buddy!

1. Create your [CNCF Slack account](http://slack.cncf.io/) and join the
   [otel-dotnet](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01N3BC2W7Q) channel.
2. Post in the room with an introduction to yourself, what area you are
   interested in (check issues marked with [help
   wanted](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/labels/help%20wanted)),
   and say you are looking for a buddy. We will match you with someone who has
   experience in that area.

Your OpenTelemetry buddy is your resource to talk to directly on all aspects of
contributing to OpenTelemetry: providing context, reviewing PRs, and helping
those get merged. Buddies will not be available 24/7, but is committed to
responding during their normal contribution hours.

## Development Environment

### How to Receive Comments

* If the PR is not ready for review, please mark it as
  [`draft`](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/).
* Make sure CLA is signed and CI is clear.

### How to Get PRs Merged

A PR is considered to be **ready to merge** when:

* It has received approval from
  [Approvers](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/master/community-membership.md#approver).
  /
  [Maintainers](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/master/community-membership.md#maintainer).
* Major feedbacks are resolved.
* It has been open for review for at least one working day. This gives people
  reasonable time to review.
* Trivial change (typo, cosmetic, doc, etc.) doesn't have to wait for one day.
* Urgent fix can take exception as long as it has been actively communicated.

Any Maintainer can merge the PR once it is **ready to merge**. Note, that some
PR may not be merged immediately if repo is being in process of a major release
and the new feature doesn't fit it.

## Style Guide

This project includes a
[`.editorconfig`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/blob/master/.editorconfig)
file which is supported by all the IDEs/editor mentioned above. It works with
the IDE/editor only and does not affect the actual build of the project.

This repository also includes [stylecop ruleset
files](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/tree/master/build).
These files are used to configure the _StyleCop.Analyzers_ which runs during
build. Breaking the rules will result in a build failure.

## Contributing a new project

This repo is a great place to contribute a new instrumentation, exporter or
any kind of extension. Please refer to
[this page](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/docs/trace/extending-the-sdk/README.md#extending-the-opentelemetry-net-sdk)
for help writing your component.
Although the projects within this repo share some
properties and configurations, they are built and released independently.
So if you are creating a new project within `/src` and corresponding test
project within `/test`, here are a few things you should do to ensure that
your project is automatically built and shipped through CI.

* Based on what your project is, you may need to depend on the
[OpenTelemetry SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTelemetry)
or the
[OpenTelemetry API](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTelemetry.Api)
Include the necessary package in your project.
You can choose the version that you want to depend on.
Usually it is a good idea to use the latest version. Example:

  ```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry" Version="1.0.0-rc4" />
  </ItemGroup>
  ```

* The assembly and nuget versioning is managed through
[MinVer](https://github.com/adamralph/minver) for all the projects in the
repo. MinVer will assign the version to your project based on the tag prefix
specified by you. To ensure your project is versioned appropriately, specify
a `<MinVerTagPrefix>` property in your project file. If your project is named
as "OpenTelemetry.Contrib.Foo.Bar", the MinVerTagPrefix must be "Foo.Bar-".
Example:

  ```xml
  <PropertyGroup>
    <MinVerTagPrefix>Foo.Bar-</MinVerTagPrefix>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ```

* To build and release your project as nuget, you must provide a GitHub
workflow to be triggered when a tag with prefix "Foo.Bar-" is pushed to the
main branch. The workflow file should be named as `package-Foo.Bar.yml` and
to be placed in the `.github/workflows/` folder.

  You can copy one of the
  [existing workflow files](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/blob/main/.github/workflows/package-Extensions.AWSXRay.yml)
  and replace the
  [`tags`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/blob/main/.github/workflows/package-Extensions.AWSXRay.yml#L12)
  value to "Foo.Bar-*" and
  [`PROJECT`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/blob/main/.github/workflows/package-Extensions.AWSXRay.yml#L18)
  value to "OpenTelemetry.Contrib.Foo.Bar".
