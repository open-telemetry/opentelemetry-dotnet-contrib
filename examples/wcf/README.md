  instrumentation on .NET Framework. The service will listen on http which
  requires special permission on Windows. The easiest thing to do is run VS with
  admin privileges. For details see: [Configuring HTTP and
  HTTPS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/configuring-http-and-https).
