Note: This release was broken due to the GenevaMetricExporter using a
TemporalityPreference of Cumulative instead of Delta, it has been unlisted from
NuGet.

is the PR that introduced this bug to GenevaMetricExporterExtensions.cs

## 1.2.4 [2022-Apr-20] Broken

This is the first release of the `OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Geneva` project. Note:
This release was broken due to using OpenTelemetry 1.2.0-rc5. Therefore, it has
been unlisted on NuGet.

* LogExporter modified to stop calling `ToString()` on `LogRecord.State` to
obtain Log body. It now obtains body from `LogRecord.FormattedMessage` or
special casing "{OriginalFormat}" only.
[295](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/295)

* Fixed a bug which causes LogExporter to not serialize if the `LogRecord.State`
had a single KeyValuePair.
