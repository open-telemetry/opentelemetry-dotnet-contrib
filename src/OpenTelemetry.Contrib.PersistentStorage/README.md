# Persistent Storage Interface and Implementation

This package provides both the interface and implementation of persistent
storage. It is an experimental component which can be used by OpenTelemetry
Exporters to provide reliable data delivery. Eventually this component should
get splitted into the abstract interface and concrete implementations.

## Basic Usage

### Setup Storage

```csharp
using var storage = new FileStorage("test");
```

Following is the complete list of configurable options that can be used to set
up storage:

* `path`: Sets file storage folder location where blobs are stored.

* `maxSizeInBytes`: Maximum allowed storage folder size. Default is 50 MB.

* `maintenancePeriodInMilliseconds`: Maintenance event runs at specified interval.
Default is 2 minutes. Maintenance event performs the following tasks:

  * Removes `*.blob` files for which the retention period has expired.
  * Removes `*.tmp` files for which the write timeout period has expired.
  * Updates `*.lock` files to `*.blob` for which the lease period has expired.
  * Updates `directorySize`.

* `retentionPeriodInMilliseconds`: Retention period in milliseconds for the blob.
Default is 2 days.

* `writeTimeoutInMilliseconds`: Controls the timeout when writing a buffer to
blob. Default is 1 minute.

### CreateBlob

`CreateBlob(byte[] buffer, int leasePeriodMilliseconds = 0)` method can be used
to store data on disk in case of failures. The file stored will have `.blob`
extension. If acquiring lease, the file will have `.lock` extension.

```csharp
IPersistentBlob blob = storage.CreateBlob(data);

// Create blob and acquire lease
IPersistentBlob blob = storage.CreateBlob(data, 10);
```

### GetBlob and GetBlobs

`GetBlob` can be used to read single blob or `GetBlobs` can be used to get list
of all blobs stored on disk. The result will only include files with `.blob`
extension.

```csharp
// Get single blob from storage.
IPersistentBlob blob1 = storage.GetBlob();

// List all blobs.
foreach (var blobItem in storage.GetBlobs())
{
    Console.WriteLine(((FileBlob)blobItem).FullPath);
}
```

### Lease

When reading data back from disk, `Lease(int leasePeriodMilliseconds)` method
should be used first to acquire lease on blob. This prevents it to be read
concurrently, until the lease period expires. Leasing a blob changes the file
extension to `.lock`.

```csharp
IPersistentBlob blob2 = blob1.Lease(10);
```

### Read

Once the lease is acquired on the blob, the data can be read using `Read`
method.

```csharp
byte[] data =  blob2.Read();
```

### Delete

`Delete` method can be used to delete the blob.

```csharp
blob2.Delete();
```

## Example

```csharp
using var storage = new FileStorage("test");

var data = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Hello, World!");

// Create blob.
IPersistentBlob blob1 = storage.CreateBlob(data);

// List all blobs.
foreach (var blobItem in storage.GetBlobs())
{
    Console.WriteLine(((FileBlob)blobItem).FullPath);
}

// Get blob.
IPersistentBlob blob2 = storage.GetBlob();

if(blob2 != null)
{
    // Lease before reading
    IPersistentBlob blob3 = blob2.Lease(10);

    // Check if the lease is acquired
    if (blob3 != null)
    {
        // Read
        System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(blob3.Read());

        // Delete
        blob3.Delete();
    }
}
```
