# Changelog

## Unreleased

* **Breaking change** Introduce `RedisInstrumentationContext` and use it
  as context for `Filter`
  ([#2977](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/2977))

* Removed the `db.redis.flags` attribute from the implementation
  as it is not part of the Semantic Conventions for Database Client Calls.
 ([#2982](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/2982))

* The new database semantic conventions can be opted in to by setting
  the `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN` environment variable. This allows for a
  transition period for users to experiment with the new semantic conventions
  and adapt as necessary. The environment variable supports the following
  values:
  * `database` - emit the new, frozen (proposed for stable) database
  attributes, and stop emitting the old experimental database
  attributes that the instrumentation emitted previously.
  * `database/dup` - emit both the old and the frozen (proposed for stable) database
  attributes, allowing for a more seamless transition.
  * The default behavior (in the absence of one of these values) is to continue
  emitting the same database semantic conventions that were emitted in
  the previous version.
  * Note: this option will be be removed after the new database
  semantic conventions is marked stable. At which time this
  instrumentation can receive a stable release, and the old database
  semantic conventions will no longer be supported. Refer to the
  specification for more information regarding the new database
  semantic conventions for
  [spans](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.28.0/docs/database/database-spans.md).
