# Changelog

## Unreleased

* Update OpenTelemetry.Api to 1.6.0.
  ([#1344](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/1344))

## 1.5.1-alpha.1

Released 2023-Jul-11

* Bumped the package version to `1.5.1-alpha.1` to keep its major and minor
  version in sync with that of the core packages. This would make it more
  intuitive for users to figure out what version of core packages would work
  with a given version of this package.

* Added a static constructor to ensure `EventCountersInstrumentationEventSource`
got initialized when `EventCountersMetrics` was accessed for the first time to
prevent potential deadlock;
e.g.: <https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/issues/1024>.

  instrument name under 63 characters.
