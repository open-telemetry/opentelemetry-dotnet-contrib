# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 1.0.0-beta.4

Released 2023-May-05

* Updated `ApplicationInsightsSampler` constructor to accept
  `ApplicationInsightsSamplerOptions` instead of a float `samplingRatio`, and
  introduced `ApplicationInsightsSamplerOptions` for Dependency Injection
  support.

## 1.0.0-beta.3

Released 2023-Feb-07

* Sampler will now return `RecordOnly` SamplingResult when the telemetry is
sampled instead of `Drop`. This will result in `Activity` to be created always
and populated with all information such as tag, events etc. This is done in
order to allow metrics collection from the generated activities.

> **Note**
> This change will have no impact on the overall sampling behavior,
but may have additional performance overhead from creating more activities.
