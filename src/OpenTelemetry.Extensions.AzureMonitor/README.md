The ```Application Insights Sampler``` should be utilized when
compatibility with Application Insights SDKs is desired, as it
implements the same hash algorithm when deciding to sample telemetry.

## Installation

```shell
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Extensions.AzureMonitor
```

## Usage

You can configure the `ApplicationInsightsSampler` with the following example.
In this example the `samplingRatio` has been set to `0.4F`.
This means 40% of traces are sampled and the remaining 60% will be dropped.

```csharp
using var tracerProvider = Sdk.CreateTracerProviderBuilder()
                            .SetSampler(new ApplicationInsightsSampler(0.4F))
                            .Build();
```
