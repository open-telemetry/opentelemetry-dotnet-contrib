# Changelog - OpenTelemetry.Contrib.Instrumentation.AWSLambda

## Unreleased

* Added public option `AWSLambdaInstrumentationOptions.DisableAwsXRayContextExtraction`.
* Extended public API of the `AWSLambdaWrapper`: added optional parent
  context (`ActivityContext`) to all `Trace` methods.
* Enhanced parent extraction: if the parent context is not provided
  then it can be extracted from the incoming request for certain types of the request.
  If the parent is not extracted from the incoming request then it can be extracted
  from the AWS X-Ray tracing header if AWS X-Ray context extraction
  is not disabled (`DisableAwsXRayContextExtraction`).
* Changed behaviour of the `OnFunctionStart` method: Activity is created even
  if the parent context is not defined.
* Breaking change: `AWSLambdaWrapper.Trace` overloads without `ILambdaContext` argument
  have been completely removed.
* Added two new `AWSLambdaWrapper.Trace` overloads without generic input arguments.
