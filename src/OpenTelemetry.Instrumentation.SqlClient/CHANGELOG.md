  ([#2582](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/2582))

## 1.11.0-beta.1

Released 2025-Jan-27

* **Breaking change** The `EnableConnectionLevelAttributes` option has been removed.
  ([#2414](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/2414))

* The `db.client.operation.duration` histogram (measured in seconds) produced by
  the metrics instrumentation in this package now uses the [Advice API](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/core-1.10.0/docs/metrics/customizing-the-sdk/README.md#explicit-bucket-histogram-aggregation)
  to set default explicit buckets following the [OpenTelemetry Specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.29.0/docs/database/database-metrics.md).
  ([#2430](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/2430))

* Enabling `SetDbStatementForText` will no longer capture the raw query text.
  The query is now sanitized. Literal values in the query text are replaced
  by a `?` character.
  ([#2446](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/2446))

* Updated OpenTelemetry core component version(s) to `1.11.1`.
  ([#2477](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/2477))

## 1.10.0-beta.1

Released 2024-Dec-09

* Drop support for .NET 6 as this target is no longer supported.
  ([#2159](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/2159))

* The new database semantic conventions can be opted in to by setting
  the `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN` environment variable. This allows for a
  transition period for users to experiment with the new semantic conventions
  and adapt as necessary. The environment variable supports the following
  values:
  * `database` - emit the new, frozen (proposed for stable) database
  attributes, and stop emitting the old experimental database
  attributes that the instrumentation emitted previously.
  * `database/dup` - emit both the old and the frozen (proposed for stable) database
  attributes, allowing for a more seamless transition.
  * The default behavior (in the absence of one of these values) is to continue
  emitting the same database semantic conventions that were emitted in
  the previous version.
  * Note: this option will be be removed after the new database
  semantic conventions is marked stable. At which time this
  instrumentation can receive a stable release, and the old database
  semantic conventions will no longer be supported. Refer to the
  specification for more information regarding the new database
  semantic conventions for
  [spans](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.28.0/docs/database/database-spans.md).
  ([#2229](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/2229),
   [#2277](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/2277),
   [#2262](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/2262),
   [#2279](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/2279))

* **Breaking change**: The `peer.service` and `server.socket.address` attributes
  are no longer emitted. Users should rely on the `server.address` attribute
  for the same information. Note that `server.address` is only included when
  the `EnableConnectionLevelAttributes` option is enabled.
  ([#2229](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/2229))

* **Breaking change**: When `EnableConnectionLevelAttributes` is enabled, the
  `server.port` attribute will now be written as an integer to be compliant with
  the [semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/attributes-registry/server.md).
  Previously, it was written as a string.
  ([#2233](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/2233))

* The `EnableConnectionLevelAttributes` option is now enabled by default.
  ([#2249](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/2249))

* The following attributes are now provided when starting an activity for a database
  call: `db.system`, `db.name` (old conventions), `db.namespace` (new conventions),
  `server.address`, and `server.port`. These attributes are now available for sampling
  decisions.
  ([#2277](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/2277))

* **Breaking change**: The `SetDbStatementForStoredProcedure` option has been removed.
  ([#2284](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/2284))

* Add support for metric `db.client.operation.duration`
  from [new database semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.28.0/docs/database/database-metrics.md#metric-dbclientoperationduration)
  on .NET 8+.
  ([#2309](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/2309))

* Add support for metric `db.client.operation.duration`
  from [new database semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.28.0/docs/database/database-metrics.md#metric-dbclientoperationduration)
  on .NET Framework.
  ([#2311](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/2311))
  * Only the following attributes are available when a trace is not captured:
  `db.system`, `db.response.status_code`, and `error.type`

* Updated OpenTelemetry core component version(s) to `1.10.0`.
  ([#2317](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/2317))

## 1.9.0-beta.1

Released 2024-Jun-17

* `ActivitySource.Version` is set to NuGet package version.
  ([#5498](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/5498))

* Updated OpenTelemetry core component version(s) to `1.9.0`.
  ([#1888](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/1888))

## 1.8.0-beta.1

Released 2024-Apr-04

## 1.7.0-beta.1

Released 2024-Feb-09

* Removed support for the `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN` environment variable
  which toggled the use of the new conventions for the
  [server, client, and shared network attributes](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.23.0/docs/general/attributes.md#server-client-and-shared-network-attributes).
  Now that this suite of attributes are stable, this instrumentation will only
  emit the new attributes.
  ([#5270](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/5270))

* **Breaking Change**: Renamed `SqlClientInstrumentationOptions` to
  `SqlClientTraceInstrumentationOptions`.
  ([#5285](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/5285))

* **Breaking Change**: Stop emitting `db.statement_type` attribute.
  This attribute was never a part of the [semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.24.0/docs/database/database-spans.md#call-level-attributes).
  ([#5301](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/5301))

## 1.6.0-beta.3

Released 2023-Nov-17

* Updated `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration` and
  `Microsoft.Extensions.Options` package version to `8.0.0`.
  ([#5051](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/5051))

## 1.6.0-beta.2

Released 2023-Oct-26

## 1.5.1-beta.1

Released 2023-Jul-20

* The new network semantic conventions can be opted in to by setting
  the `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN` environment variable. This allows for a
  transition period for users to experiment with the new semantic conventions
  and adapt as necessary. The environment variable supports the following
  values:
  * `http` - emit the new, frozen (proposed for stable) networking
  attributes, and stop emitting the old experimental networking
  attributes that the instrumentation emitted previously.
  * `http/dup` - emit both the old and the frozen (proposed for stable)
  networking attributes, allowing for a more seamless transition.
  * The default behavior (in the absence of one of these values) is to continue
  emitting the same network semantic conventions that were emitted in
  `1.5.0-beta.1`.
  * Note: this option will eventually be removed after the new
  network semantic conventions are marked stable. Refer to the
  specification for more information regarding the new network
  semantic conventions for
  [spans](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.21.0/docs/database/database-spans.md).
  ([#4644](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/4644))

## 1.5.0-beta.1

Released 2023-Jun-05

* Bumped the package version to `1.5.0-beta.1` to keep its major and minor
  version in sync with that of the core packages. This would make it more
  intuitive for users to figure out what version of core packages would work
  with a given version of this package. The pre-release identifier has also been
  changed from `rc` to `beta` as we believe this more accurately reflects the
  status of this package. We believe the `rc` identifier will be more
  appropriate as semantic conventions reach stability.
