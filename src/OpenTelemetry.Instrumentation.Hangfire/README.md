This is an
[Instrumentation Library](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/glossary.md#instrumentation-library),
which instruments
[Hangfire](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hangfire/)
and collects traces and metrics about BackgroundJob executions.

## Steps to enable OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Hangfire

> [!NOTE]
> The following steps show how to enable **tracing**. For metrics, see the
> [Metrics](#metrics) section below.

### Step 1: Install and configure Hangfire

[Getting Started](https://docs.hangfire.io/en/latest/getting-started/index.html)

### Step 2: Install Hangfire instrumentation Package

Add a reference to the
[`OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Hangfire`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Hangfire)
package. Also, add any other instrumentations & exporters you will need.

```shell
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Hangfire --prerelease
```

### Step 3: Enable Hangfire Instrumentation at application startup

Hangfire instrumentation must be enabled at application startup.

The following example demonstrates adding Hangfire instrumentation to a
console application. This example also sets up the OpenTelemetry Console
exporter, which requires adding the package
[`OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console/README.md)
to the application.

```csharp
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        using var tracerProvider = Sdk
            .CreateTracerProviderBuilder()
            .AddHangfireInstrumentation()
            .AddConsoleExporter()
            .Build();
    }
}
```

For an ASP.NET Core application, adding instrumentation is typically done in
the `ConfigureServices` of your `Startup` class. Refer to [example](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/examples/AspNetCore/Program.cs).

For an ASP.NET application, adding instrumentation is typically done in the
`Global.asax.cs`. Refer to [example](../../examples/AspNet/Global.asax.cs).

## Advanced configuration

This instrumentation can be configured to change the default behavior by using
`HangfireInstrumentationOptions`.

```csharp
using var tracerProvider = Sdk
    .CreateTracerProviderBuilder()
    .AddHangfireInstrumentation(options =>
    {
        options.DisplayNameFunc = job => $"JOB {job.Id}";
        options.Filter = job => job.Id == "Filter this job";
        options.RecordException = true;
    })
    .AddConsoleExporter()
    .Build();
```

When used with
[`OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting/README.md),
all configurations to `HangfireInstrumentationOptions`
can be done in the `ConfigureServices` method of your applications `Startup`
class as shown below.

```csharp
// Configure
services.Configure<HangfireInstrumentationOptions>(options =>
{
    options.DisplayNameFunc = job => $"JOB {job.Id}";
    options.Filter = job => job.Id == "Filter this job";
    options.RecordException = true;
});

services.AddOpenTelemetry()
    .WithTracing(builder => builder
        .AddHangfireInstrumentation()
        .AddConsoleExporter());
```

### RecordException

Configures a value indicating whether the exception will be recorded as
ActivityEvent or not. See
[Semantic Conventions for Exceptions on Spans](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/exceptions/exceptions-spans.md)

```csharp
using var tracerProvider = Sdk
    .CreateTracerProviderBuilder()
    .AddHangfireInstrumentation(options =>
    {
        options.RecordException = true;
    })
    .AddConsoleExporter()
    .Build();
```

### DisplayNameFunc

This option allows changing activity display name.

```C#
using var tracerProvider = Sdk
    .CreateTracerProviderBuilder()
    .AddHangfireInstrumentation(options =>
    {
        options.DisplayNameFunc = job => $"JOB {job.Id}";
    })
    .AddConsoleExporter()
    .Build();
```

If not configured the default is

```C#
$"JOB {BackgroundJob.Job.Type.Name}.{BackgroundJob.Job.Method.Name}"
```

### Filter

This option can be used to filter out activities based on the `BackgroundJob`
being executed. The `Filter` function should return `true` if the telemetry is
to be collected, and `false` if it should not.

The following code snippet shows how to use `Filter` to filter out traces for
job with a specified job id.

```csharp
using var tracerProvider = Sdk
    .CreateTracerProviderBuilder()
    .AddHangfireInstrumentation(options =>
    {
        options.Filter = job => job.Id == "Filter this job";
    })
    .AddConsoleExporter()
    .Build();
```

## Metrics

This instrumentation library collects metrics following the OpenTelemetry
[workflow semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/workflow/workflow-metrics.md).

In Hangfire, the workflow semantic conventions are applied as follows:
- Each background job execution is modeled as a **workflow task execution**
- Workflow-level metrics track the complete lifecycle (including scheduled jobs)
- Execution-level metrics track the execution pipeline (enqueued jobs and later)

This approach provides comprehensive visibility into both job creation/scheduling and
actual execution performance.

### Enabling Metrics

Metrics are enabled by adding Hangfire instrumentation to the `MeterProviderBuilder`:

```csharp
using OpenTelemetry.Metrics;

var meterProvider = Sdk.CreateMeterProviderBuilder()
    .AddHangfireInstrumentation()
    .AddConsoleExporter()
    .Build();
```

The above example also sets up the OpenTelemetry Console exporter, which requires
adding the package
[`OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console/README.md)
to the application.

### Enabling both Traces and Metrics

To collect both traces and metrics from Hangfire:

```csharp
using OpenTelemetry.Metrics;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
    .WithTracing(tracing => tracing
        .AddHangfireInstrumentation()
        .AddOtlpExporter())
    .WithMetrics(metrics => metrics
        .AddHangfireInstrumentation()
        .AddOtlpExporter());
```

### Metrics Configuration

Metrics behavior is configured through the `HangfireMetricsInstrumentationOptions` class
in the `OpenTelemetry.Metrics` namespace.

#### RecordQueueLatency

By default, the instrumentation records only the execution phase duration (time spent
actually running the job). To also track the pending phase duration (time spent waiting
in the queue before execution), enable the `RecordQueueLatency` option:

```csharp
var meterProvider = Sdk.CreateMeterProviderBuilder()
    .AddHangfireInstrumentation(options =>
    {
        options.RecordQueueLatency = true;
    })
    .AddConsoleExporter()
    .Build();
```

When enabled, `workflow.execution.duration` is recorded with `workflow.execution.state="pending"`
representing queue wait time, in addition to `workflow.execution.state="executing"` for actual
execution time.

> [!WARNING]
> Enabling `RecordQueueLatency` requires an additional database query per job execution
> to retrieve the enqueue timestamp. In high-throughput scenarios, this may impact
> performance.

> [!NOTE]
> Add `using OpenTelemetry.Metrics;` to access `HangfireMetricsInstrumentationOptions`.

#### DisplayNameFunc

Metrics use the `DisplayNameFunc` from `HangfireMetricsInstrumentationOptions` to populate
`workflow.task.name` and related attributes. By default, it calls `backgroundJob.Job.ToString()`,
but you can provide your own formatter:

```csharp
var meterProvider = Sdk.CreateMeterProviderBuilder()
    .AddHangfireInstrumentation(options =>
    {
        options.DisplayNameFunc = backgroundJob => $"{backgroundJob.Job.Type.Name}:{backgroundJob.Id}";
    })
    .AddConsoleExporter()
    .Build();
```


### Available Metrics

The following metrics are emitted by this instrumentation:

**Execution-level metrics** track jobs that have entered the execution pipeline:
- `workflow.execution.outcome` - Counter for completed executions
- `workflow.execution.duration` - Histogram for execution duration (pending and executing phases)
- `workflow.execution.status` - UpDownCounter for current execution state
- `workflow.execution.errors` - Counter for execution errors

**Workflow-level metrics** track the complete job lifecycle:
- `workflow.outcome` - Counter for completed workflows
- `workflow.status` - UpDownCounter for current workflow state (including scheduled jobs)

| Succeeded, Failed, Deleted         | `completed`    | (inherited from previous state) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Difference between `workflow.status` and `workflow.execution.status`:**
>
> - **`workflow.status`**: Tracks the complete workflow lifecycle, including jobs that haven't
>   started execution yet (e.g., scheduled jobs waiting for their trigger time). This provides
>   visibility into jobs across all states.
>
> - **`workflow.execution.status`**: Tracks only jobs that have entered the execution pipeline
>   (enqueued or later). Scheduled jobs do NOT appear here until they become enqueued.
>
> For example, a scheduled job appears in `workflow.status{state=pending, trigger.type=schedule}`
> but NOT in `workflow.execution.status` until it becomes enqueued. Once enqueued, it appears
> in both metrics.

### Semantic Conventions

This instrumentation follows the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for workflows:

#### Attribute Usage

- **workflow.platform.name**: Always set to `"hangfire"`
- **workflow.task.name** / **workflow.definition.name**: Derived from the Hangfire job method (e.g., `ClassName.MethodName`)
  - `workflow.task.name` is used for execution-level metrics (`workflow.execution.*`)
  - `workflow.definition.name` is used for workflow-level metrics (`workflow.outcome`, `workflow.status`)
- **workflow.trigger.type**: Identifies how the job was initiated
  - `"cron"` for recurring jobs
  - `"schedule"` for delayed jobs (scheduled for future execution)
  - `"api"` for fire-and-forget and continuation jobs
  - Only included on workflow-level metrics (`workflow.outcome`, `workflow.status`), not on execution-level metrics (`workflow.execution.*`)
- **workflow.execution.result** / **workflow.result**: Set to `"success"` when jobs complete without errors,
  `"failure"` when an exception is thrown
- **workflow.execution.state** / **workflow.state**: Maps Hangfire states to semantic convention states
  - `workflow.execution.state` tracks execution pipeline states (used in `workflow.execution.status`, `workflow.execution.duration`)
  - `workflow.state` tracks complete workflow lifecycle (used in `workflow.status`)
  - See state mapping tables above for details
- **error.type**: Set to the full type name of the exception when a job fails

#### Workflow vs Execution Metrics

The instrumentation distinguishes between **workflow-level** and **execution-level** metrics:

**Workflow-level metrics** (`workflow.outcome`, `workflow.status`):
- Track the complete lifecycle of jobs, including pre-execution states (e.g., scheduled)
- Use `workflow.definition.name`, `workflow.state`, and `workflow.trigger.type`
- Provide visibility into all jobs regardless of execution status

**Execution-level metrics** (`workflow.execution.*`):
- Track only jobs that have entered the execution pipeline (enqueued or later)
- Use `workflow.task.name` and `workflow.execution.state`
- Do NOT include `workflow.trigger.type` (trigger is a workflow-level concept)
- Provide detailed execution performance metrics
