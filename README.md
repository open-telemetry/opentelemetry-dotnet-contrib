This project is intended to provide helpful libraries and standalone
OpenTelemetry-based utilities that don't fit the express scope of the
[OpenTelemetry .NET](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet) or
[OpenTelemetry .NET Automatic
Instrumentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-instrumentation)
projects.
