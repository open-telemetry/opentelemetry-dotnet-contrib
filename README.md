This project is intended to provide helpful libraries and standalone
OpenTelemetry-based utilities that don't fit the express scope of the
[OpenTelemetry .NET](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet) or
[OpenTelemetry .NET Automatic
Instrumentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-instrumentation)
projects.

## Project status

This repository is a collection of components maintained by different
authors and groups. As such, components shipped from this repository (via
[Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/)) may be at different stability/maturity levels.
The status for each individual component is mentioned in its respective
`README.md` file and will fall into one of the following categories:

### Development

Component is currently in development and is NOT available on
[Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/).

### Alpha

The component is ready to be used for limited non-critical workloads and the
authors of this component would welcome your feedback. Bugs and performance
problems should be reported, but component owners might not work on them right
away. Components can go through significant breaking changes and there are no
backward compatibility guarantees. Package versions in this status have the
`-alpha` extension (eg: opentelemetry.exporter.abc-1.0.0-alpha.1).

### Beta

Same as Alpha, but comparatively more stable. Package versions in this status
have the `-beta` extension (eg: opentelemetry.exporter.abc-1.0.0-beta.1).

### Release candidate

Component is close to stability. There may be minimal breaking changes between
releases. A component at this stage is expected to have had exposure to
non-critical production workloads already during its **Alpha/Beta** phase(s),
making it suitable for broader usage. Package versions in this status have the
`-rc` extension (eg: opentelemetry.exporter.abc-1.0.0-rc.1).

### Stable

The component is ready for general availability. Bugs and performance problems
should be reported and the component owner(s) SHOULD triage and/or resolve them
in a timely manner. The package versions MUST follow [SemVer
V2](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Support

This repository is maintained by [.NET Contrib maintainers](#maintainers) team
and [.NET Contrib approvers](#approvers) who can help with reviews and code
approval. However, as individual components are developed by numerous
contributors, approvers and maintainers are not expected to directly contribute
to every component. The list of owners for each component can be found in
component's `Readme.md` file.
