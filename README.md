This repository contains set of components extending functionality of the
OpenTelemetry SDK. Instrumentation libraries, exporters, and other components
can find their home here.

Packages in this repository are prefixed with `OpenTelemetry.Contrib` to highlight
that they are different from the packages produced by the primary .NET SDK repository.
