This repository contains set of components extending functionality of the
OpenTelemetry SDK. Instrumentation libraries, exporters, and other components
can find their home here.

Packages in this repository are prefixed with `OpenTelemetry.Contrib` to highlight
that they are different from the packages produced by the primary .NET SDK repository.

## Support

This repository is maintained by [.NET SDK
maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/teams/dotnet-maintainers)
team and [.NET SDK
approvers](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/teams/dotnet-approvers) can
help with reviews and code approval. However, as individual components are
developed by numerous contributors, approvers and maintainers are not expected
to directly contribute to every component.

This repository is great for community supported components. Vendor specific
code that requires a higher supportability guarantees needs to be placed in
vendor's repository. Packages in vendor repositories would be prefixed with the
vendor name to signify the difference from community-supported components.
