# OpenTelemetry Shared Tests

## SqlProcessor Tests

`SqlProcessorTestCases.json` contains test cases for the `SqlProcessor` class.
This is synced from the [Semantic Conventions repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/non-normative/database-test-cases/db-sql-test-cases.json)
and should not be modified directly.

`SqlProcessorAdditionalTestCases.json` contains additional test cases which
may be contributed back to the semantic conventions repo.
